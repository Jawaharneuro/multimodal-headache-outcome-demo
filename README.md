This repository contains a research prototype exploring how explainable AI can be used to predict outcomes in headache and facial pain disorders.



\## Aim

To demonstrate:

\- NLP-based extraction of headache phenotypes from clinical-style text

\- Predictive modelling of chronic transformation / poor treatment response

\- Explainable outputs suitable for clinician-facing decision support



\## Data

All data used in this repository are:

\- Synthetic or publicly simulated

\- Fully de-identified

\- Used for methodological demonstration only



No NHS, NAHD, or real patient data are included.



\## Methods

\- Rule-based and NLP phenotyping from free-text notes

\- Tabular ML model for outcome prediction

\- Explainability using feature importance



\## Status

This is an early-stage prototype developed as part of PhD preparation.





\## Demo Screenshot



Below is a screenshot from the Streamlit prototype showing:

\- NLP-derived phenotype extraction

\- Predicted risk of poor outcome

\- Interpretable feature importance

\## Ethics and Data Use

This project uses only synthetic, simulated data created for demonstration purposes.

No real patient records, NHS systems, or national audit datasets are accessed or included.

The prototype is intended solely as a methodological proof-of-concept for research training.



\## Limitations

\- The model is trained on a very small synthetic dataset and is not clinically validated.

\- Predictions are illustrative only and must not be used for clinical decision-making.

\- Future work would involve validated EHR and imaging datasets under appropriate ethical approvals and governance.
